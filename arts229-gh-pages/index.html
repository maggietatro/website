        <p><strong>This is a demo template for my new class site design. It is built using only HTML and CSS. Design is iterative so this is definitely a work-in-progress. Tweaks and changes will happen as new challenges are encountered.</strong></p>

        <p>Lansing Community College has begun to promote accessibility in all course content. This is a positive move that I fully support.
        </p>

        <p>I have used Google Drive in the past for all my course content. While I believe Drive is accessible, I know that pure HTML content is far more accessible. Plus, as a web designer, I was intrigued by the challenge of developing a design system
          for my course site. This page serves as a demonstration of the different components and elements that I can use for building a functional course.</p>

        <p>The visuals are formatted to seamlessly integrate with the Desire2Learn course management system that Lansing Community College uses. Of course there are a few visual tweaks to add some personality. The layout is responsive as well, so content
          will shift around when viewed on different screen sizes. The hope is that this will function cleanly on all devices, even cell phones.</p>
