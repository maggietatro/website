        <p>As a review of basic HTML & CSS, we are going to be playing around with using images on a website. You can load images through HTML as actual objects that take up space, but you can also load images through CSS as backgrounds of other objects. We will explore both methods.</p>

        <p>I will cover most of the concepts as a class demo. I expect that you will complete the demo with me and then explore on your own. There are plenty of resources in the weekly notes for you to dig deeper.</p>

        <p>A few basic concepts we will be experimenting with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>loading repeating background images</li>
          <li>setting an image to fit the size of its container</li>
          <li>styling images using CSS</li>
          <li>using color gradients as images</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To challenge yourself:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>use clipping tricks to add images to text or custom shapes</li>
          <li>creating image hover effects</li>
        </ul>

<hr>

<p>In the end, I would like for you to have a single html page that utilizes at least EIGHT different images/effects including both CSS backgrounds and HTML image elements. Content and organization is purely up to you. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="one-third column box">
        <h2>NOTES</h2>
        <p>Since this is a design class, I will expect you to spend time developing the visual of your pages. We are going to focusing on the coding and technical portion of web design in class, however visual design is also important. You will be graded on both aspects for every assignment.</p>
