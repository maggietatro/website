                <h2>SHARED GOOGLE FOLDER SETUP</h2>

                <p>As an LCC student, you have a Google Drive account for storing your files. You will create a folder in your Drive and share with me.</p>

                <p><span class="colorBoxSmall">1</span> Login to the <a href='https://cas.lcc.edu/cas/login?service=https://my.lcc.edu/c/portal/login'>lcc.edu</a> portal.</p>

                <p><span class="colorBoxSmall">2</span> In the upper-right corner of your main page click the link to student email. </p>

                <p><span class="colorBoxSmall">3</span> In the upper-right corner of your email, click the 3x3 grid box and select Drive. This is your digital storage account. </p>

                <p><span class="colorBoxSmall">4</span> Press the big blue <strong>NEW</strong> icon in the upper left and select <strong>Folder</strong>. Name your folder <strong><em>105 lastname first name.</em></strong></p>

                <p><span class="colorBoxSmall">5</span> Right-click on the new folder and choose to <strong>Share…</strong> your folder with me at <a href='mailto:bennetc7@lcc.edu' target='_blank'>bennetc7@lcc.edu</a></p>

                <p><span class="colorBoxSmall">6</span> Please give me permission to <strong>Edit</strong> that folder.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="one-third column box">
                <h2>NOTES</h2>
                <p>This setup will only give me access to the content of one particular folder. I can’t see anything else in your google drive. This is a good thing. Please remember to turn in all assignments to this folder.</p>

                <p>I will create a <strong>Graded</strong> folder within our shared folder. When I am done grading an assignment, it will get moved into the Graded folder. That lets me easily know what assignments need to be graded/regraded.</p>
