        <p>Hello Junior Web Designers.</p>
        <p>I’m <a href="https://chad-bennett.github.io/home/" target="_blank">Chad</a> and I will be your guide through <strong>ARTS 229 - Computer Graphics/Advanced Web Design</strong>.</p>

        <p>I see this course as an exploration and expansion of all the stuff you did in ARTS 173. You should have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. We will go much deeper with those, plus we will explore JavaScript and other coding languages. We will
          play with some of the different frameworks, systems, and libraries that are out there. You will create many web experiments and build several functional websites over the course of the class.</p>

        <p>Web design is a constantly shifting landscape. Languages are evolving. Browsers frequently update with new capabilities. New techniques are shared on a daily basis. It is impossible to keep up with everything. I'm still not even sure what content
          is worth covering in this class. So, this class is really going to be a series of experiments and explorations. I will share ideas, resources, and techniques. You will also explore and share new ideas as well.</p>

        <h2>STUFF</h2>
        <p>All the important boring stuff is in the <a href="#" target="_blank">Concourse Syllabus</a>. We’ll review the basics during the first class session. Here are a few highlights...</p>
        <ul>

          <li>We meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:10 - 5:00. We will spend a lot of time doing demos and exploring concepts together, so attendance will be important. I will allow a random absence here or there, because life gets busy and complicated
            sometimes, however I reserve the right to drop you after four missed classes.</li>

          <li>There is no required textbook for this class. I will have links to resources for each concept we cover. You can also find some general links to cool website stuff in the <a href="#">Important Class Stuff</a> section. I'm always up for more resources,
            so if you find something that is worth sharing with the class, please send it my way.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>ASSIGNMENT/GRADING BREAKDOWN</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Experiments</strong> - smaller assignments based on concepts and techniques discussed in class. You will follow in-class demos and modify to create your own variations. 30% of overall grade.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Explorations</strong> - self-directed explorations of code concepts and techniques. You will search for tools and techniques, build something, and share with the class. 20% of overall grade.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Projects</strong> - functional websites utilizing specific concepts from class. Basically, applying what you learn with the Experiments and Explorations. 40% of overall grade.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Participation</strong> - showing up to class, contributing to discussion forums, and participating in critiques. 10% of overall grade.

        </ul>

        <h2>CLASS SITE</h2>
        <p>I tried to make the class site easy to use. Here are a few notes about how things are organized... </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Most of the content is organized by week. Just hit the folder on the left navigation for each week. You will find assignments and resources there.</li>
          <li>I don't like the Calendar feature in d2l, so use the weekly calendar for detailed information. There is a more general <a href="#">calendar for overall course flow and deadlines</a> in the <a href="#">Important Class Stuff</a> section.</li>
          <li>You can get to your grades from the link above. I try to get your assignments graded before the start of next week’s class. If I’m behind, feel free to gently remind me that you are patiently waiting.</li>
          <li>You can also get to the email system from the link above. LCC would like for you to use this system for communicating with me so they can keep track of everything. If you send me email to any other account, I will gently remind you to use this
            email system instead. </li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <p>Despite having a family and other outside interests, I seem to live at LCC. My office is Gannon 1253, way down at the end of the hall. My office hours will be the hour before class. Feel free to stop by and visit. I am also willing to meet you
          in the classroom before class if you would like. </p>

        <p>If you need to call me, my office phone number is 517.483.1121. I tend to listen to loud music on my headphones when I’m in the office, so please leave a message if I don’t answer. I will be sure to get back to you within a business day of receiving
          your message. </p>

        <p>If you need technical help with the class site, please contact the LCC Help Desk at 517.483.5221 or visit the Help Desk website at <a href="http://www.lcc.edu/helpdesk/">http://www.lcc.edu/helpdesk/</a>. They can't help with the class content
          stuff. To learn more about navigating D2L and the tools within D2L, please visit the eLearning Student Resource Site at <a href="http://elearning.openlcc.net/students/">http://elearning.openlcc.net/students/</a>.</p>

        <p>I think that’s it. Enjoy the class!</p>
