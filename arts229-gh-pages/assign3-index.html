        <p>As a first web experiment project, I would like for you to create a basic HTML page to serve as a portal to your work for this class.</p>

        <p>This is a sort of pre-test of how much you remember about web design. I'm not going to give you a template or starting file, it is up to you to start from scratch. I will help you get going if you need it though, so please ask.</p>

        <p>A few basic requirements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>saved as index.html</li>
          <li>welcome section introducing yourself</li>
          <li>separate labeled sections for Experiments, Explorations, and Projects</li>
          <li>unordered lists for links to your different assignments (use placeholders for now)</li>
          <li>internal css styling to add a bit of visual zing</li>
          <li>a backlink to the student portal - </li>
        </ul>

        </div>

      <div class="one-third column box">
        <h2>NOTES</h2>
        <p>Since this is a design class, I will expect you to spend time developing the visual of your pages. We are going to focusing on the coding and technical portion of web design in class, however visual design is also important. You will be graded on both aspects for every assignment.</p>
