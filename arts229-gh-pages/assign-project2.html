        <p>You will be creating a website about a topic of your choosing. I am fairly open to content choice and presentation. You get to choose what is interesting to you and how you want to present the information.</p>

        <p>This project is meant to be a demonstration and application of the different tools and concepts we have covered so far in class, as well as content you would have learned in previous arts courses. While grading will include aesthetics and
          visual organization, emphasis will be on building proper functional code.</p>

        <h2>PROJECT SPECIFICS</h2>
        <p>These are the primary things I will be expecting:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a minimum of five linked pages only - don't make it too overwhelming for yourself or your audience</li>
          <li>use a single external css file instead of internal</li>
          <li>use semantic html tags for page structure</li>
          <li>use css grid techniques to build overall page layout</li>
          <li>responsive web design using media queries and a mobile-first approach - at least three screen size variations (mobile, tablet, desktop)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>ADDITIONAL TECHNIQUES</h2>
        <p>These are the extra required bits that should be included in the project:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>webfonts</li>
          <li>use of javascript of some sort</li>
          <li>favicons</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        <h2>PROCESS & SCHEDULE</h2>
        <p>As a larger project, it is important to break down the greater whole into smaller pieces. This includes both content and process. It is good to know what you are making and how you are going to get it completed by deadline. I have a few
          intermediate deadlines to help you complete the project.</p>

        <p>You will be doing some preliminary developmental work to figure out your project. Things may change as you work, that is fine, but I still want to see evidence of development. You may change and work on these throughout the project, so
          don't feel like these are discrete steps that must be completed one after the other.</p>
