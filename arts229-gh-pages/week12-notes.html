        <h2>STYLE GUIDES &amp; PATTERN LIBRARIES</h2>
        <p>these are the rules and guides and notes on how a product, brand, site should be handled visually. these list colors and fonts, how to handle logos and other branding, etc., often with a rationale for why the rules exist. style guides can
          exist for both print and web. when it comes to web design, the style guide is often coded as a living example of how to implement the styles. </p>

        <h2>MODULAR WEB DESIGN</h2>
        <p>the appeal of modular web design has been growing quite a bit lately. the fundamental idea is that you code small modules and elements that can be combined in any way as needed to build your site. this is in contrast to templates designs
          that are built to have content fitted into.</p>

        <h2>CSS FRAMEWORKS</h2>
        <p>a framework is a foundation system that has been built to help you create consistent websites. the idea is to have a set of modular elements that can be used to build your site. usually these systems are a set of styles for different HTML
          elements so you can have functional columns, layouts, buttons, typography, etc. right out of the box. each framework is unique and has its own internal logic that may or may not make sense to you.</p>

        <h2>WEB DESIGN INSPIRATION</h2>
        <p>it can be scary to stare at a blank html page with no content and no sense of visual direction. so don't do that. take the time to do some visual research. there are plenty of places to get inspiration on how to approach web design.</p>
        <p>remember, you are not looking to steal a site completely, but you may find some neat ways of integrating specific elements or a cool color scheme. many of the highlighted sites have lots of cool effects that you may not be able to create yet. that's fine. focus on simplicity and functionality in your work. as you gain experience, you will figure out how to do the wild stuff.</p>
