        <p>Everyone in this class is at a different level in understanding how to code. Some of you are just trying to figure out the basics while others are quite advanced. Since many different concepts exist within the realm of web design, all of you are going to have different interests and things you are curious about. So, I am giving you the opportunity to explore your interests by assigning open exploration projects.</p>

        <p>For these assignments, I would like for you to find demos, tutorials, techniques that you want to learn more about. I have given you plenty of resources already on the class site, but there are probably thousands more out there. Seek out something interesting and then work through the information by creating some sort of webpage. Do what the demo shows, but then add to it, personalize it, make it your own.</p>

        <p>You will post your exploration on your site and link to it from your index page.</p>

        <p>You will also create a discussion forum post explaining what you did. Add a link to your page and links to whatever resources you used as your inspiration. The idea is that you can share your learning experience with your colleagues.</p>

        <p>To spur discussion, I am requiring you to comment on at least two other people's posts. Add something meaningful to the discussion, don't just heap praise. Think of ways to improve the visuals or how the idea can be adapted to other content.</p>

      <div class="one-third column box">
        <h2>NOTES</h2>
        <p>Since this is a design class, I will expect you to spend time developing the visuals of your pages. We are going to focusing on the coding and technical portion of web design in class, however visual design is also important. You will be graded on both aspects for every assignment.</p>
