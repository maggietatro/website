        <p>In 173, you were given server space to host your work. In this class, you will be hosting your work in a more permanent location. If you have your own web hosting account already, you may use that for your account. It is possible to use GitHub
          for free hosting of basic webpages (HTML, CSS, JS - no PHP, MySQL, Wordpress, etc.).</p>

        <h2>NOTES</h2>
        <p>GitHub is a platform to store and share your code. It is a verstion-control platform, which means it saves every draft and change you make to your files. Branching allows you to make copies of files and alter the code to have different versions. Forking allows you to take someone else's code and make your own version. It is a powerful and popular system. <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/" target="_blank">This page explains in more detail.</a></p>

This is a big deal. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17422788/microsoft-github-acquisition-official-deal" target="_blank">Here's another article about the $7.5 billion acquisition.</a>
