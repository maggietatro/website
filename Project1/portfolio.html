          <p>Michigan State University Federal Credit Union (MSUFCU) is the largest university-based credit union in the world in membership and asset size and is the official financial services partner of Oakland University.</p>

<p>As a UX Designer at MSUFCU, I work on projects that impact employees, members, and the public. A lot of the work I do is proprietary information, so I'm unable to provide details of all of my work on a public site like this.</p>

<p>I went through several iterations before deciding on this final site design for my portfolio site. I did a lot of research and created a series of wireframes before I started coding. </p>

<p>I was exposed to a lot of new technical information in a short amount of time and used this knowledge to develop this site from scratch. </p>

<p>There were a few times that I considered abandoning this idea for something less challenging, but resources on the internet, coding gurus around me, and my own stick-to-itiveness got me through. </p>

<p>There is a lot I haven't tackled yet so I'm continuing to expand my web design skills by experimenting, exploring, and asking lots of questions. </p>

                                            on November 7, 2008. This freelance opportunity introduced me to an inspirational person and to the intricacies of freelance work.</p>

                                          <p>I spent several years as a part-time freelance photographer and managed multiple projects in the US and abroad. I worked with diverse clients to determine and succesfully meet project specifications
                                            and deadlines and aquired a lot of skills that I still use today.

                                            <p>Eventually, I sold my photography equipment and stopped freelancing so that I could shift my focus to developing skills that align with my long-term professional interests.</p>
                                            <p>I still have a deep appreciation for photography - but I no longer enjoy being behind the camera. I do, however, still really enjoy the aspect of collaborating with others to meet a common goal.</p>
